### Clica is thinking
The user has sent "this is a test" as a task. This is quite vague and doesn't specify what kind of test they want or what they want me to do.

I'm currently in PLAN MODE, which means I should focus on gathering information and understanding what the user wants before presenting a plan.

Since the task is extremely vague ("this is a test"), I should ask a clarifying question to understand what the user actually wants me to do. This could be:

1. A test of my capabilities
2. Testing if I'm working properly
3. Creating some kind of test file or test suite
4. Something else entirely

I should use the ask_followup_question tool to clarify what they mean by "this is a test".

### Clica responds
I received "this is a test" as your task, which is quite open-ended. To help you effectively, I need to understand what you'd like me to do.

### Clica has a question
What would you like me to help you test? For example:

• Are you testing if I'm working properly?
• Do you want me to create a test file or test suite for a project?
• Are you testing specific functionality or capabilities?
• Something else?

Options:
1. Testing if you're working properly
2. Create a test file/suite
3. Test specific functionality
4. Other (I'll explain)
